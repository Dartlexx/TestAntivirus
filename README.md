# TestAntivirus
Test task to detect EICAR virus apps

* Since usage of libraries is discouraged then simple calls and returns will be used where I would have used RxJava primitives (Single, Completable, Flowable, etc.)

* Repository module is created to display usage of CleanArchitecture - in the real app it would have synced storage and remote modules and also contained some logic for offline\online states of the app. In this example repo classes are nothing more than simple wraps around storage classes.
